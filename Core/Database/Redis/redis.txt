1. Create Userâ€™s score and leaderboard in redis.


---- ZADD ----- : Add one/more member for a given score to ZSET/initialize a ZSET with one/more member.

< ZADD sectionA:history 70 Arjun 90 Raju 80 Shashi />

# Create a history score(integer) of section A using ZSET and Add three members with their respective scores



---- ZRANGE -----: Fetches all the items in the ZSET from their position in sorted order.

< ZRANGE sectionA:history 0 10 WITHSCORES />

# Fetch students from ZSET sectionA:history with position 0 to 10 (Only 3 students)

2. Create an array of geo locations and find the shortest path.


--- Add several locations to a geospatial index:

GEOADD bikes:rentable -122.27652 37.805186 station:1
GEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2674626 37.8062344 station:2
GEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2469854 37.8104049 station:3
GEOADD bikes:rentable -122.27621 37.80590 station:4
GEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2671241 37.8032142 station:5


--- Find all locations within a 5 kilometer radius of a given location, and return the distance to each location:

GEOSEARCH bikes:rentable FROMLONLAT -122.2612767 37.7936847 BYRADIUS 5 km WITHDIST
